    <h2>Habs delegates at MUNCH</h2>
    <h4>This year, Habs Elstree sent 18 delegates to Cheadle Hulme School's Model United Nations conference.</h4>
    <div class="blog-box">
        <p>"MUNCH 2025 was a conference to remember.</p>
        <p>
            It was my first time debating in Security Council, and the standard
            of debate was extremely high. Our issues, Haiti's security and the Houthi rebels felt very relevant given
            the current situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year's crisis topic was delivered in a very fun format as well. I've never been to a conference where the
            crisis was delivered as breaking news, interrupting committees, alongside an excellent video (complete with
            leaked footage of the crisis and those involved). In the world's current political state, four
            billionaires conducting illegal activities on an unowned island seems extremely plausible.
        </p>
        <p>
            General Assembly was also delivered exceptionally, split into four forums for each area of the crisis. Everyone
            was engaged with the debate and the chairs controlled the room well, ensuring that the debate ran smoothly throughout.

            Congratulations to the Habs students who won very well-deserved delegate awards. It was great to see
            Habs leaving their mark on the wider community.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a great conference overall and we look forward to sending many more Habs delegates there in the future."

        <h3>Thoughts from other Habs students:</h3>
        <p>"MUN Cheadle Hulme was my first experience of a conference outside my school. It was the perfect way to
            spend my weekend with lots of debating and lots of fun. I was especially grateful to the kind chairs running
            my committee for making everyone feel welcome and play a part, even though I was younger than most of the
            delegates. I am looking forward to debating there again in the coming years!"</p>
