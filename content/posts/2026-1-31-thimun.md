**This year, Habs Elstree sent 10 delegates to The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) conference.**

From 27–30 January, 10 students from Habs Elstree attended the THIMUN 2026 conference — four days of intensive collaboration and rigorous debate that kept our delegates constantly on their toes.

The fast-paced and competitive atmosphere did little to deter us. Across multiple committees, we successfully passed two resolutions — an impressive achievement considering that only 96 resolutions were passed overall from proposals submitted by more than 200 delegations. This placed Habs among the most impactful contributors at the conference.

Representing Viet Nam, every member of our delegation found opportunities to speak, advocate, and negotiate. Our strong public speaking and diplomacy ensured our perspectives were heard and respected throughout the debates.

Beyond committee sessions, we developed a valuable international network, connecting with students from schools across the globe — many of whom we have remained in contact with. We also explored the beautiful city of The Hague, taking part in various excursions that provided a welcome opportunity to relax after each intense day of debate.

Overall, THIMUN 2026 was a brilliant experience. We strengthened our teamwork, communication, and collaboration skills while refining the arts of compromise and diplomacy on an international stage.

— *Cormack Horn (Year 12) | Ambassador of Viet Name*
