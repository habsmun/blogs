    <h2>Habs delegates at MUNCH</h2>
    <h4>This year, Habs Elstree sent 18 delegates to Cheadle Hulme School's Model United Nations conference.</h4>
    <p>"I throroughly enjoyed MUNCH 2025. It was my first time debating in Security Council, and the standard 
        of debate was extremely high. Our issues, Haiti's security  the Houthi rebels felt very relevant given
        the current situation. This year's crisis topic was delivered in a very fun format as well. The breaking 
        news (an excellent video by the way) interrupted committees. In the world's current political state, four 
        billionaires conducting illegal activities on an unowned island seems extremely plausible. It was a great 
        conference overall and we look forward to sending many more Habs delegates there in the future."</p>
